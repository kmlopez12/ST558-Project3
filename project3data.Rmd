## Read in Data

Data from these 2 sites: <https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans?select=beers.csv> and <https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans?select=breweries.csv>.

```{r getData}
library(tidyverse)
beers <- read_csv(file = "/Users/klopez/Dropbox (UNC Charlotte)/!ST558_NCSU/Project3/beers.csv")
breweries <- read_csv(file = "/Users/klopez/Dropbox (UNC Charlotte)/!ST558_NCSU/Project3/breweries.csv")


breweries <- breweries %>% rename(brewery_id = X1)
beers
breweries
```

## Join Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r joinData}
beer <- full_join(beers, breweries, by = "brewery_id")
beer <- beer %>% rename(beer_name = name.x, brewery_name = name.y)
beer

library(readr)
write_csv(beer, "/Users/klopez/Dropbox (UNC Charlotte)/!ST558_NCSU/Project3/ST558-Project3/beer.csv", append = FALSE)
```
